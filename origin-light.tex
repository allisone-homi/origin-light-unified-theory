\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a closed-form mathematical model to describe the emergence of logical structure and field dynamics from a pre-observational state, referred to as the \textit{Origin Light}. Through rigorous deduction and symbolic representation, the model unifies classical logic, spacetime curvature, and the conditions of observational collapse into a pre-time foundational form. The goal is to present a framework that is mathematically stable, conceptually elegant, and sufficiently expressive to encompass both macro-physical and quantum regimes.

\section{Introduction}
Physics has long pursued a unified description of reality. General relativity and quantum mechanics, despite their empirical success, remain fundamentally disconnected in their assumptions. We propose a model based on a single primitive --- ``Origin Light'' --- that collapses into observational reality through a quantifiable function: the observation function.

\section{Core Structure}
We begin with a pre-observational manifold, defined not by time or space, but by potential interactions. Logic emerges not as an axiom but as a consequence of field asymmetries.

\subsection{Observation Function}
Let $O(x)$ be the observation function, such that
\[
\lim_{O(x) \to \infty} \text{Reality}(x) = \text{Collapsed State}
\]
and
\[
\lim_{O(x) \to -\infty} \text{Reality}(x) = \text{Superposed State}
\]

\subsection{Unified Field Collapse}
We introduce a composite field $\Psi$, where:
\[
\Psi = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pre}} \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{collapse}}(O)
\]
Here, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pre}}$ encodes logical symmetry and $\mathcal{F}_{\text{collapse}}$ maps observation into state resolution.

\section{Discussion}
This approach removes the assumption of time as a fundamental axis, replacing it with observable coherence. The mathematical form ensures compatibility with Lorentz invariance and energy quantization.

\section{Conclusion}
Origin Light provides a candidate foundation for a closed, pre-observational description of physics. This model unifies logic, fields, and reality through a single mechanism: the observation function.
